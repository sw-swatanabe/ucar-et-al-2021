These are the Matlab codes that were used in Ucar et all., Nature 2021

FLIM_analysis can be used to build lifetime images and A1% images and their quantification. 
   or this program to function, 'Read_PTU_tag.m', which is provided by PicoQuant, is required.

FV_analysis can be used to quantify evoked-calcium transients. 

Liescan_analysis can be used to quantify release probability by using iGluSnFR linescanning data.

miniEPSC_analysis can be used to quantify frequencies and amplitudes of miniEPSCs.
  Forusing miniEPSC, an additional function (findpeakG) is necessary which can be downloaded from
