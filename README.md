# these are the Matlab codes that were used in Ucar et all., Nature 2021

# FLIM_analysis can be used to build lifetime images and A1% images and their quantification. 
  #For this program to function, 'Read_PTU_tag.m', which is provided by PicoQuant, is required.
# FV_analysis can be used to quantify evoked-calcium transients. 
# linescan_analysis can be used to quantify release probability by using iGluSnFR linescanning data.
# miniEPSC_analysis can be used to quantify frequencies and amplitudes of miniEPSCs.
  #for using miniEPSC, an additional function (findpeakG) is necessary which can be downloaded from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11755-peak-finding-and-measurement-2019
